# GithubSearch

This project demonstrates I know how to do Angular, GraphQL, and hook up apis.
I'm looking for a remote job. Hire me, lol ;) https://bkinsey808.github.io/resume/

## Accomplished Goals

Re-implements a portion of GitHub's search, using public GraphQL api.

Uses latest version of angular and angular-cli.

Apollo-graphql installed via `ng add apollo-angular`.

Displays a paginated list of user results

Allows jump to first, prev, and next pages.

Displays total count of search results.

Displays notable info about user: login, name, bio, avatar, and allows jump to profile.

## non-goals

This project does not do anything with css/UX, nor automated testing, nor devops, nor is it optimized to minimize speed or download size. It was a quick coding challenge for demo purposes only.
